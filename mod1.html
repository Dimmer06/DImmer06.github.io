    <h1>Mod 1: Project Euler intro and even finonnaci numbers</h1> 
    <p>
      I will be writing code in ruby. I am using a number of reaources to learn but one of the ways I am testing myself
      is on <A href = 'https://projecteuler.net/' target = 'blank'>ProjectEuler</A>, a website which hosts a number
      of math problems which are ade significantly easier with code. The video below is just a video of the script in atom but
      I have a full video which I couldn't upload here because it was over 25MB.
      <a href='code/p2.rb' target='_blank' >Here</a> is the script.
      <A href='https://youtu.be/T_9qmLFJ41A' target = 'blank'> Here </A> is the full video on youtube.
