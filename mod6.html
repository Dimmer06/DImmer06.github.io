    <h> Ceasar Cipher </h>
    <img src ='images/mod6.png'>
    <p> This was a break from the more structured and functional programming to approach a novelty application, a Ceasar Cipher.
        A Ceasar Cipher is a cryptogram which adjusts every letter in the message a predetermined number of letters (usually up)
        The predetermined number is the key to the cipher. So with a key of 3 e becomes b, a would become x, and so on. Ruby comes
        with an encoding class which allows changing characters to their ASCII values and integers back to characters, which I 
        used in these programs. <a href = 'code/CCipher/cce.rb' >CCE</a> is the encrypter and <a href = 'code/CCipher/ccd.rb'>CCD</a> is the 
        decrypter. It took a little while to figure out the algorithm for letters towards the beginning or the end of the alphabet and how to
        handle capital letters but it worked out. There are a few characters which these programs cannot handle correctly (they convert to '?') 
        so please don't use the alt key in your input.
