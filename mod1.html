    <h1>Mod 1: Coding in #{language}</h1> 
    <p>
       I will be writing code in ruby. I have learned some basic scripting in ruby but I want to learn how to integrate it
       into more complex programs for websites and programs. 
       Also I have no idea what that video is but I needed a video so yeah. 
       And I have a practice script <a href='code/mod1.rb' target='_blank' >here</a>.
