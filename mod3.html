    <p>
    For my third module I made Tic Tac Toe in ruby. It took a little longer than I thought it would because it took a little 
    while for me to understand the syntax for multidimensional arrays and I my method for determining a win probably isn't
    particularly efficient given it's a giant if/elsif statement. It was a case statement but I changed it to an if statement
    to try something else and I didn't bother to change it back. While it works it isn't particularly pretty.
