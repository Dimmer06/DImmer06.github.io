    <h1 id="text">Building a VM in ruby</h1>
    <p id="text">This is me doing the CodeAcademy course on ruby. I've done the whole of the program though I still have
    some problems with classes, particularly regarding their inheritance, their reltaionships, and how ruby treats
    particular instances of the class, but they form the basis of most coding languages so it is something I'll have
    to get a hold of. This particular VM is very basic and <a href='code/vm.rb' target='_blank' >Here</a> is the code.
    I played with it and tried to add mutliple functions such as logging in and out, different users on the same machine, 
    and simulated file storage, but I ran into problems such as Ruby's treatment of subclasses. Also CSS!(definitely not
    a huge headache)</p>
