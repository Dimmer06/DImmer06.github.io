    <h>Linked Lists</h>
    <img src =images/mod5.png>
    <p> Ruby lacks a built in linked list structure unlike many other languages. Instead it has a number of functions to make 
        arrays easily accessible and more functionable such as .pop, .push, and .insert_at. The use of arrays makes linked 
        lists obsolete in the abstract however in some cases it can be more effective to use a linked list due to the list's
        ability to dynamically use memory whereas arrays cannot. Initially I found these by trying to build a binary tree and
        running into some issues doing so. All of my attempts are in the <A href = "https://github.com/Dimmer06/DImmer06.github.io/tree/master/code/linkedlist">linked list</A>
        directory. <a href = "code/linkedlist/mod5.zip"> This one </a>(download) is the one I would submit due to its simplicity
        and functionality however the other two are in the repo. I don't believe either really creates a linked list because
        they rely heavily on arrays however one generates a random string of 10 letters and one has much more functionality.
