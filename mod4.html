    <h>Bubble sort</h>

    <p> Bubble sort is a common sorting algorithm taught to new programmers that sorts a list. It is called 'bubble sort'
        because the values in the array bubble towards the left or right side of the array. The whole concept seems kind
        of pointless in ruby due to ruby's built in .sort method which is faster. The bubble sort I have is 
      <a href = bs.rb>here</a> and it generates a  random array of 100 integers, sorts it from minimum to maximum, and 
      outputs it to the console. It also looks like I intended to add a right to left sort but didn't get around to it.
      The video is just of it functioning.
